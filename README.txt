INTRODUCTION

JDAL is an open source Java library that aims to help developers
making database applications easily. JDAL helps you to find what you
really need to code and what is already coded in a common java
database application, avoiding the complexity of many common
programming tasks.

JDAL is built on top of Hibernate ORM and Spring framework and
provides you with a set of core database services and UI Componentes
ready to be used via configuration on Spring context configuration
files.

Please, read our sample application for quicker information.
